Introduction
This project focuses on building a scalable and maintainable web application using Angular as the frontend framework. Additionally, a DevOps pipeline is integrated to automate build, test, and deployment processes using tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, and SonarQube. The primary aim is to ensure seamless application delivery, continuous integration, and easy management of microservices.

Frontend - Angular
The Angular part of the project handles the user interface (UI) and implements all required components for interaction. The frontend communicates with APIs and is designed to be responsive and user-friendly.

Key Features:
Component-based architecture for modularity and reusability.
Routing with routerLink for internal navigation.
Form handling using Reactive Forms.
Built-in authentication system for user management.
DevOps Tools
To automate the development lifecycle, the following tools are used:

Docker:
Containerization of the Angular app.
Ensures consistency across environments (development, testing, production).
Dockerfile is included to build a production-ready image of the Angular app.
Kubernetes:
Container orchestration to manage and deploy Docker containers.
Kubernetes configurations for running the Angular application in clusters, enabling scaling and high availability.
Support for Helm charts for easier management of Kubernetes applications.
SonarQube:
Static code analysis to ensure quality, maintainability, and security.
Continuous integration pipeline integrated with SonarQube to perform code analysis and generate reports.
Technologies Used
Frontend: Angular, TypeScript, HTML, CSS
DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, SonarQube
CI/CD Tools: Jenkins (optional, if implemented)
Version Control: Git, GitHub (or GitLab, Bitbucket, depending on your repository hosting)
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites:
Node.js (for Angular development)
Docker (for containerizing the application)
Kubernetes (for orchestration)
SonarQube (for static code analysis)
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
Install Angular dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Docker setup:
To build the Docker image:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t angular-app .
To run the Docker container:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -p 8080:80 angular-app
Kubernetes setup:
Install Helm (if using Helm charts).
Deploy your app to Kubernetes:
bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl apply -f k8s/
(Ensure your k8s/ directory contains the necessary deployment and service files for Kubernetes.)

Running SonarQube analysis:
Set up SonarQube server (either locally or on a cloud provider).
Integrate the SonarQube scanner into your CI/CD pipeline or run it locally using the following command:
bash
Copy
Edit
sonar-scanner
Deployment
Once the application is ready and Dockerized, the deployment process can be automated with Kubernetes. We have configurations in the repository for deploying the app to a Kubernetes cluster.

Steps for Deployment:
Ensure you have a running Kubernetes cluster (either local or cloud-based).
Set up Helm for easier Kubernetes management.
Use kubectl to deploy the app:
bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl apply -f k8s/
